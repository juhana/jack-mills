WALKTHROUGH


Ask the professor about these things: ITEM, THIEF, ADDRESS (or read the papers on the officer's desk). Drive to the hotel. 

Go to the back street. Open the waste container and the white trash bags. Take the knife. Close the waste container and climb on it. Jump. Go up. Break or unlock the window with the knife (or push the BMW and take the room key when the receptionist goes outside). Enter the room. Read the calendar. Read the poster on the wall. Drive to the club.

Ask the bartender about Geigner. When he asks for your name, say GREENFELD. Give him your knife. Enter the back room. Sit down, take a cigar and smoke it. Ask Geigner about the coin. Agree to the trade. Go outside and enter the Dodge. Look back. Agree to Violet's proposal. You can now follow either Violet's or Geigner's quest:


VIOLET'S QUEST

Drive to the restaurant. Go behind the window. Wait. When Geigner arrives, wait until he goes inside the restaurant. Photograph him. (NOTE: If Geigner doesn't arrive: go inside the restaurant, ask the waiter about a reservation, say you're Geigner, go to the dining area and sit on the chair, ask the woman about Violet.) Go to your car and enter it (or slash Geigner's BMW with the knife before you enter the car).

Drive N, N, E (there are also other "right" routes but they all lead to the same place). Go up with the elevator. Push the wheelbarrow.


GEIGNER'S QUEST

Drive to the police station. Call Greenfeld (the number is inside the matchbook. If you didn't smoke the cigar earlier, this quest becomes impossible.) Drive to Greenfeld.

Option 1: Go to the garden, moisten the mask with water and remove it with the knife. Scrape it with the knife and break the chin. Go to the auction. Take the real mask and put the fake one on the pedestal. Leave.

Option 2: Go to the auction. Wait until you can bid for the mask and bid until you have the highest bid and therefore win the mask. Take the mask and leave. Give the assistant Geigner's business card.
